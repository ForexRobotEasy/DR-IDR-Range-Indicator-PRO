# DR IDR Range Indicator PRO

This code is a part of the DR IDR Range Indicator PRO, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this indicator is to calculate and plot the Average Daily Range (ADR), Open Daily Range (ODR), and Range Daily Range (RDR) for a specified number of days. These ranges are important for traders as they provide insights into potential price movements and volatility.

## How It Works

The main function, `OnInit()`, serves as the entry point for the program. It specifies the number of days for calculation and then calls the following functions in sequence:

1. `calculateRanges(numDays)`: This function calculates the ADR, ODR, and RDR for each day within the specified number of days. It calls the respective calculation functions (`calculateADR()`, `calculateODR()`, `calculateRDR()`) for each day and plots the calculated ranges on the chart using the `plotRange()` function.

2. `backtestStrategies()`: This function is responsible for backtesting trading strategies using the calculated ranges. It implements the logic for evaluating the performance of different trading strategies based on the ADR, ODR, and RDR.

3. `implementAdvancedStatistics()`: This function implements fully customizable advanced statistics for traders. It allows traders to analyze the ranges and their impact on trading strategies using a wide range of statistical tools and techniques.

4. `testCode()`: This function is used to thoroughly test the code, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. It includes test cases and validation checks to verify the correctness of the implemented logic.

The `OnStart()` function serves as a placeholder for any necessary code for program execution. It can be used to initialize variables, connect to external APIs or databases, or perform any other required tasks.
